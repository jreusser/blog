I get it--we need to have a common way for "leadership" to identify the work we're doing.

Know how we _don't_ do that? By creating a "register here to innovate" link.

My. Word. 

talk about stifling--and the setup?

I just spent 30mins trying to setup an SSO-supported SSH token on github.

Maybe I'm just a sweet summer child, but I have _never_ had to use this level of security with an SSH-key before. Why? So we can't reuse SSH keys? Is that really a threat model?

I guess so.. but it seems pretty unlikely. Doubly so for an _innovation_ department. 

I'm sick of it. I'm sick of working by committee, of solving problems that garner millions for the customer. I'm just... sick of it. 

I want to build my own tools, that provide value in their own manner.
