Woof. What a day. 

Performed a statistical analysis of 2800 planned code updates, spanning between 9 and 39 weeks of effort. 

Glad that's behind me, as I'm off to collect seeds for bonsai. 

Gotta say--life is way more rich when you're making progress.

I should probably get this up on the web, too...

Seed collecting went wel. Got ~250 various coniferous seeds. They're in the freezer, stratifying now.
