# Hello world
#New-Beginnings #Organization
This is Jacob Reusser. 

I've created this blog to track my various projects. 

Over the years, I've explored many concepts, from music to 3D printing, to AI--but I've never kept track of my progress. 

That changes today. (Ohoho. So important.)

In the coming weeks, I'll chronicle my challenges/goals/dreams. 

Let's get to it!
