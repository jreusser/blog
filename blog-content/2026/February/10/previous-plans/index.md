# Vision Board
#money 
About 4 years ago, I started a vision board. 

10/08/2021: Started. 
On that, I put a goal: $30,000/year: Financial Indepencence by 2025. 

Well, 2025 came, and 2025 went. And, my "side hustle" made me... $180? Over 2 years?

$50 came from iOS app sales, but I spent $75--so really that's -$25

THe other ~$130 came from in-person ceramics sales--but I'm about $6k in the hole, in terms of investment.

So, I didn't make that goal. Maybe it was too big. 

Zig Ziglar says we can't have monumentous goals, like, "I'm going to make $1million next year after making $50,000 as a car salesman". It's unrealistic. 

But, I'm already compensated well in excess of $30k. Society is clearly willing to pay for my abilities. 

I just need to find a way to build a "side hustle" doing the same thing I do for my 9-5, right?

No. 

About a year ago, I wanted to develop my ceramics into a full time job.  I'd need to sell an incredible amount of pottery, or at prices I doubt are reasonable. 

It's just frustrating. Pink Floyd says, "no one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun".
And it's true--I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this time. 

I know what I want the end result to be: Passive or Semi-passive income, following an investment of time and capital. 

I'd like that to be a website or webapp. 

Heck--I ever tried this with quanttriggers.com (SEC Filings sentiment analyzer powered by on-prem AI)

And.. I got 0 buyers. 

I tried to go too big, too fast. I had a stripe integration, my LLC's bank account... and I was exhausted and scared.

Exhausted because I built the thing in two weeks, using every minute of my time.

Scared because I'd built all this and now.. I needed to do something!

But I didn't. 

Instead, I shut down the proxy, and set the site to non-renew. 

I think... if I don't see the immediate explosive successs I expect, I feel like I failed. 

Which is silly, right?

Failure comes when we stop trying--not when things don't go as-planned. 

Maybe I should dust quanttriggers off. Heck, I need to take inventory of my IP.
